Ques3: . Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Sol:

1. Unary Operators:

Unary operators operate on one operand. These operators either change the value of the operand or perform some operation based on it.
Examples:
Unary plus (+): Converts the operand into a number.
        let str = "5";
        let num = +str; // 5 (string is converted to number)

Unary minus (-): Negates the value of the operand.
        let x = 10;
        let negX = -x; // -10

Increment (++): Increases the value of the operand by 1.
        let a = 5;
        a++; // 6

Decrement (--): Decreases the value of the operand by 1.
        let b = 3;
        b--; // 2

2.Binary Operators:

Binary operators operate on two operands. These are the most common type of operators in JavaScript.
Examples:
Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical operations.
        let sum = 5 + 3; // 8 (Addition)
        let diff = 10 - 4; // 6 (Subtraction)
        let product = 2 * 3; // 6 (Multiplication)
        let quotient = 15 / 3; // 5 (Division)
        let remainder = 7 % 2; // 1 (Modulus)

Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables
        let x = 10; // Assignment
        x += 5; // x is now 15 (Addition assignment)

Comparison Operators: Compare two values and return a boolean result.
        let isEqual = 5 == 5; // true (Equal to)
        let isStrictEqual = 5 === "5"; // false (Strict equal to)
        let isGreater = 10 > 5; // true (Greater than)

Logical Operators: Combine boolean values and return a boolean result
        let result = true && false; // false (Logical AND)
        let either = true || false; // true (Logical OR)

Bitwise Operators: Perform operations on binary representations of numbers.
        let and = 5 & 1; // 1 (Bitwise AND)
        let or = 5 | 1; // 5 (Bitwise OR)


3. Ternary Operator:
The ternary operator is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands. It is used as a shorthand for an if...else statement to conditionally assign a value based on a condition.
Syntax:
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;

Example:
let age = 18;
let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No"; // "Yes"
